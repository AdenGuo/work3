The link of my map can be found in reference.
I chose map of Beijing which is the capital of China. Beijing is an ancient city and have been the political center of China for almost 1000 years. Beijing today is one of the biggest cities in the world with about 30 million people live in.  
The reason I chose Beijing is I live in Beijing. And I familiar with many aspects of map of Beijing so I can do a better data wrangling.
