This is project 3 assignment in Data Analyst Nanodegree from udacity.

[OpenStreetMap Sample Project Data Wrangling with MongoDB.html](https://rawgit.com/adenguo/work3/master/OpenStreetMap%20Sample%20Project%20Data%20Wrangling%20with%20MongoDB.html) is the main html report file for the project. I suggest those who do not want to run ipython to open this file in the browser. And I strongly recommand read this file for better performance.

OpenStreetMap Sample Project Data Wrangling with MongoDB.ipynb is the original ipython notebook file for creating the main report.

OpenStreetMap Sample Project Data Wrangling with MongoDB.pdf is the pdf file of main report. 

The folder lesson_6_quizzes contains Python code for Lesson 6 quizzes. Other codes used in the wrangling process are within root directory.

introduction is a text file containing link and description of the area I chose to wrangle with. And The reason I chose Beijing is in this file.

sample_beijing.osm is the sample file of map of Beijing.

reference is a text file containing link to resources that I used in this project.
