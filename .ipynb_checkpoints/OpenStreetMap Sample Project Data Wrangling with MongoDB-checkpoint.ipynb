    "Three problems are presented:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Problems associated with different type of keys of tag elements. Uniformity of keys makes search through Mongodb more easily. There are three procedures I have done to improve uniformity of keys. First, I find a handful chinese characters as keys in the xml. And I will discard these tag. Second, many keys with multiple words containing underscore(\"_\") or hyphen(\"-\"). I replace all the hyphens with underscore for uniformity of keys. Third, all the uppercase letters are replaced by lower case letters. These procedures are done in \"xml_to_json.py\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Problem with colons in keys of tag element. As we can see from the result of running \"audit.py\". Some keys contain a single colon(\":\") and some keys contain double colons. Usually, colon means existence of sub-class. However, a smaller number of keys containing double colons which indicate level-two sub-class. I think level-one subclass is a standard way of dealing with these keys. I replace the second colon with underscore. And all these keys will only contain one colon. I construct sub-classes from these keys. For example, I have three keys with colon: \"name:ch:simplified\", \"name:ch:traditional\" and \"name:en\". These keys will form such structure: name_other:{ch_simplified:..., ch_traditional:...,  en:...}. Noticing that I add \"_other\" suffix to make a new group of word. The procedure is also in \"xml_to_json.py\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Problem of names. I noticed that some values of 'name' tag are neither Chinese character nor English words, such as \"Guxiang 20\" in the above output of \"audit.py\". These names are all pinyin which is a phonetic system of chinese characters. And these names are hardly used as names in Chinese. Luckily, these pinyins can be easily translated into more meaningful Chinese words. I replace all the pinyin in 'name' tag in the process. The procedure are also in \"xml_to_json.py\"."

I will plot how contribution of lower updating users evolved acrossing time. Following is the figure. The figure shows that during last 8 years, the counting is consistently increasing. I believe that this is the evident which shows the Openstreetmap is making significant progress during last few years.

    "The map data of Beijing from Openstreetmap is carefully examined and summarized. Important features such as scale, user, updating time and other statistical numbers were given by this article. Several problems associated with this dataset are proposed and most of them are solved in a systemic way. These problems include inconsistency of keys, irregularity of words and improper names of entities. \n",
    "I observed the map data is far from completeness. The map lack a lot of descriptions of nodes especially. And I also noticed that many names in the data set is in pinyin which is not a right way to identify map entities. Some commit history is examined and showed to verify the fact that the user of Openstreetmap is in a consistent growing.   "
